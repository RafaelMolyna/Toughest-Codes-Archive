## 👋 Welcome

Hello! Ever searched for a solution to a 1% acceptance rate problem,
only to find... nothing? Even when you do find one, a 50-line C++ file
with zero comments isn\'t always helpful.

**This repository is my contribution to filling that void!**

When I started programming, I jumped into **Competitive Programming** to
fill the gaps in my knowledge of Computer Science algorithms and data
structures. I practiced extensively on **Beecrowd** (formerly URI
Online Judge), enjoying its friendly interface and categorized
difficulty levels.

So I'm providing here some revised solutions I created at that time,
solving some of the most intricated and challenging problems in the 
platform. Some of them are really creative and smart, and took me a
bunch of time and deep reflection to make. Enjoy! 🎉

### 💭 The Philosophy

My strategy to master a new subject has always been to tackle the
**hardest problems** first. In my experience—from college entrance
exams in Brazil to engineering coursework—this yields the best results
in the shortest time.

However, finding a good solution for a hard problem is difficult. It
can take weeks to solve a single puzzle. When you hit that wall, the
standard process is to look for guidance: scan a solution, break it
down, understand the logic, and then implement it yourself.

**The Problem:** I frequently faced amazing, challenging problems but
couldn\'t find **one single suggestion**. No tips, no comments, just
void.

I lamented this \"hiding\" culture. While ranks matter to some, I
believe the **real gold** lies in understanding how to unpuzzle these
intricate challenges.

> **This repository is my contribution to filling that void.**

## 🎯 Why This Matters

This isn\'t just a code dump. It is an educational archive.

1. **Documentation:** I focus on problems with a difficulty level of
   **7 or above** (scale 1-10).
2. **Evolution:** You will see my code evolve. I include my
   **original solutions** (from when I was learning, sometimes messy)
   alongside **AI-revised** and optimized versions.
3. **Polyglot:** While I started with JavaScript, I provide C++ and
   Python comparisons to match the \"top league\" performance
   standards.

## ⚡ Why JavaScript?

You might ask: _\"Why solve competitive programming problems in JS?\"_

I know it isn’t the traditional competitive-programming weapon — C++ owns that territory.  
But I was building my career in the JS ecosystem, and choosing JS for algorithmic challenges helped me sharpen:

- efficient JS data structures
- memory patterns
- dynamic optimization
- bitwise manipulation
- low-level tuning inside a high-level language

Eventually, I also implemented C++ and Python versions whenever JS hit its limits or when comparison was useful.

Finding performant public solutions for JS was incredibly rare. I
struggled with that, so now I am fixing it for the next person.

## 📂 Repository Structure

To keep things organized and scalable for future platforms, the
archive is structured as follows:

```text
/
├── BeeCrowd/                  # Solutions for Beecrowd (URI)
│   ├── 1023-Drought/          # Problem ID and Name
│   │   ├── README.md          # Step-by-step logic explanation
│   │   ├── solution.js        # Clean, commented, revised code
│   │   ├── solution.cpp       # C++ version for performance comp
│   │   ├── solution_original.js # My raw, original submission
│   │   └── input_samples.txt
│   └── ...
├── CodeForces/                # (Future placeholder)
└── README.md
```

## 🔍 What is Inside a Solution?

Every solution folder in this archive contains:

1. **Step-by-Step Explanation:** A detailed Markdown file breaking
   down the logic, the algorithm used, and the history of the
   attempt.
2. **Fully Commented Code:** Optimized solutions in JS, C++, and
   Python (where possible), including headers with rank and runtime.
3. **Original Solution:** The accepted code I wrote years ago,
   untouched by AI. This serves as a baseline to show logic
   improvements and refactoring.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

I am building this in the open, but I can't find every bug or
optimization alone.

**HAVE THE COURAGE TO SHARE.**

If you have a better approach—a faster algorithm, a bug fix, or a
cleaner syntax—don't hoard it.

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Create** a folder for a new hard problem (following the structure
   above) OR improve an existing one.
3. **Submit** a Pull Request.

Let's make this the best-explained archive of hard problems on the
internet, together.
